This is a very simple YouTube video to audio converter I made because I got tired of the ad spam that you find on online converters.

To run this appliaction, you must:
1. Install the latest version of Python
2. Open this folder in the terminal
3. Enter the following command in the terminal: `python -m venv venv`
4. Type in `venv\scripts\activate` to install everything into a virtual terminal
5. Then install the packages by typing `pip install -r requirements.txt`
6. Finally, run the application by typing `python main.py`
